        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
        <p> Our signature garlic flavor stuffed into and drizzled on the cheesy crust. Served with Special Garlic Dipping Sauce.</p>
        <h2><em>Ingredients needed:</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>two eggs</li>
            <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>toppings of your choice</li>

        <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).</li>
            <li>Make the pizza sauce: Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.</li>
            <li>Prepare the toppings: Slice or tear the fresh mozzarella into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the pieces of fresh mozzarella cheese evenly across the dough, then top with the shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle evenly with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
