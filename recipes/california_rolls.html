    <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Seasoned Sushi Rice</li>
        <li>Toasted Sushi Nori Seaweed</li>
        <li>Cooked Crab Meat</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Japanese Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Optional: Toasted Sesame Seeds</li>
    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Sushi Rice: To keep the sushi rice fresh & prevent them from drying out while you prepare other ingredients, cover the rice container with a wet towel.</li>
        <li>Toast Sesame Seeds: Toast 8g sesame seeds over medium heat for a few minutes until light brown.</li>
        <li>Make Crab Mayo Filling: First, shred 200g imitation or real crab meat with 2 forks. Then, mix shredded crab meat with 3 tbsp (45g) – ¼ cup (63g) Japanese Mayo. Be sure to taste and season this crab mayo filling with a pinch of salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Julienne English Cucumber: Julienne ¼ English cucumber.</li>
        <li>Slice Avocado: Cut avocado in half, then remove the avocado seed with a spoon. With a spoon, separate the avocado from its skin. Finally, slice the avocado into roughly 3mm slices.</li>
        <li>Spread Rice on Nori Sheet: First, place the sushi mat on the countertop. Then, layer a piece of plastic food wrap on top of the sushi mat to prevent the sushi rice from sticking to the sushi mat. Since we’re making regular-size California rolls, cut the nori sheets in halves with scissors or a knife. Layer the nori at the edge of the sushi mat & plastic food wrap (rough side up).</li>
        <li>Now we’re going to form a rice ball with the sushi rice with our hands. First, wet both hands with water to prevent the sushi rice from sticking to your hands. Form a rice ball using roughly 105g – 115g of sushi rice.Place the rice ball on top of the nori, then lightly push out the rice & evenly distribute it across the whole halved nori sheet. Then, sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on the sushi rice.</li>
        <li>Add Ingredients to Nori Sheet:Carefully, flip the whole nori sheet over (rice side down). Add roughly ¼ of the crab meat mayo mixture on top of the nori sheet.Layer 6 julienned cucumbers and 3 slices of avocado on top of the nori.</li>
        <li>Roll California Roll: Line the whole sushi rice & nori sheet to the bottom edge of the sushi mat closest to you. With your hands, tightly roll the sushi mat from the bottom without squeezing it too hard.As you roll up the mat, use your fingers to tuck in & enclose all the filling ingredients to prevent them from falling out. Then, lift the edge of the mat, and continue to roll it up until it turns into a firm cylinder sushi roll.</li>
